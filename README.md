# K-Best Feature Selection Using Scikit-Learn: A Simple Tutorial

## Overview
In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement the K-Best feature selection technique using scikit-learn. This method allows you to select the top K features based on statistical tests, ensuring that only the most relevant features are retained for your analysis or machine learning model.

The primary goal is to understand how K-Best feature selection can simplify datasets, reduce noise, and improve model performance by focusing on the most significant features.

This tutorial is beginner-friendly and covers essential K-Best techniques. For more advanced topics, future notebooks will delve into other feature selection methods and their applications.

## Dataset
We will use a dataset with the following characteristics:

- **High-dimensional features**: The dataset contains many features, some of which may be irrelevant or redundant.
- **Target variable**: The focus will be on identifying the relationship between the feature set and the target variable.

This dataset is ideal for demonstrating how K-Best can highlight the most relevant features, discarding noise or less useful dimensions.

## Notebook and Code
The main objectives of this notebook are to:

1. **Visualize the data**:
   - Use plots to observe the initial feature distribution and relationships.

2. **Implement K-Best**:
   - Apply K-Best to select the most informative features from the dataset.
   - Explore scores assigned to features by statistical tests.

3. **Evaluate K-Best impact**:
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models using the selected features.
   - Compare the performance of models trained on the original feature set versus the K-Best-reduced feature set.

4. **Visualize selected features**:
   - Plot the data distribution and relationships for the selected features.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** (preferably version 3.x)
- **scikit-learn**: To install, run `pip install scikit-learn`
- **pandas**: To install, run `pip install pandas`
- **matplotlib**: To install, run `pip install matplotlib`
- **seaborn**: To install, run `pip install seaborn`

Familiarity with Python and basic data manipulation using pandas is helpful but not mandatory.

## Getting Started

1. **Load the Dataset**:
   - Use pandas to load and explore the dataset.

2. **Visualize the Data**:
   - Create scatter plots or heatmaps to understand feature correlations and distributions.

3. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Standardize the features using `StandardScaler` if required for consistent scaling.

4. **Apply K-Best**:
   - Use scikit-learnâ€™s `SelectKBest` class to select the top K features.
   - Specify a scoring function such as `f_classif` (for classification tasks) or `f_regression` (for regression tasks).
   - Fit and transform the dataset to retain only the selected features.

5. **Train Models**:
   - Train machine learning models on the original and K-Best-reduced feature sets (e.g., using `LinearRegression`, `RandomForest`, or `KNeighborsRegressor`).

6. **Evaluate and Compare Models**:
   - Use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values for regression tasks or accuracy and F1-score for classification tasks to measure performance.

7. **Visualize Selected Features**:
   - Use scatter plots or pair plots to visualize the relationship between the selected features and the target variable.

## Conclusion
By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand how to implement K-Best for feature selection using scikit-learn.
- Learn how to choose the number of features to retain based on domain knowledge or model performance.
- Be able to compare the performance of models trained on the original feature set versus the K-Best-reduced feature set.
- Visualize and interpret the selected features in relation to the target variable.

Happy coding, and enjoy discovering the power of K-Best in data analysis!
